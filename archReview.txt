This script should be run on the master, as the Zenoss user.
It will not pick up anything related to HA.  

To run it:
./archReview.py –f <filename to create> -c <company name> -t <title of report>

The –f and –t options are especially useful if you have multiple environments (eg, Dev, Test).
The script will append a .tgz to the filename supplied (the output is a gzipped tar file).
