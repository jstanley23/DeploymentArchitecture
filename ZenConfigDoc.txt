Architecture Script - 5.x ZenConfigDoc: 

Download the script onto a system which meets the following requirements
 - HTTPS access to the CC Master
 - Python available

Download command:

wget -q https://github.com/zenoss/DeploymentArchitecture/blob/master/ZenConfigDoc.sh

Once downloaded, make sure the script is executable and run it with the appropriate input parameters. 
If you have any special characters in your password, it's best to enclose them in single quotes.

The syntax for execution is:
 
ZenConfigDoc.sh [-h] [-O OUTPUTPATH] -c CUSTOMER -e ENVIRONMENT -C CCHOST –u USERNAME -p PASSWORD -R RMHOST -U RMUSER -P RMPASS
 
An example syntax from a test machine is:
/root/ZenConfigDoc.sh -c test -e prod -C 10.88.111.112 -u root -p zenoss -R zenoss5.zenoss.loc -U admin -P 'Example!'
 
PASSWORD -R RMHOST -U RMUSER -P RMPASS
OUTPUTPATH is the path for the output - /tmp by default
CUSTOMER is customer name
ENVIRONMENT is a description of the installation - Prod, Dev, etc.
CCHOST is the Control Center Host or IP
USERNAME is the CC user
PASSWORD is the CC password
RMHOST is the Resource manager 
 
Once run, a single TGZ file will be generated which should be returned to Zenoss for review.
